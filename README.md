# Abstract

Predicting academic achievement is pivotal for
educational institutions aiming to enhance learning outcomes and
tailor individualized support. This research examines a diverse set
of predictive variables encompassing demographics, historical
academic performance, and socioeconomic indicators to evaluate
the proficiency of machine learning algorithms in forecasting
academic success. In particular, the study focuses on the
comparative efficacy of Random Forest and Gradient Boosting
models. Rigorous data preprocessing and model training have
been conducted on a vast dataset of student profiles to identify the
most salient features influencing educational attainment. The
application of these advanced analytical techniques has not only
expanded the existing corpus of educational data mining but also
highlighted the potential of machine learning in educational
settings. Our findings contribute to a nuanced understanding of
the interplay between student characteristics and academic
results, offering a solid foundation for the creation of strategic
interventions. Such interventions are essential for bolstering the
performance of students at risk, thereby nurturing an equitable
educational landscape where each learner's potential can be fully
realized.
